# Imagify | Skip \<picture\> Tag Replacement

Excludes `<img>` tags from `<picture>` tag replacement for WebP display if they have either a data-skip-picture-replacement="yes" attribute or "skip-picture-replacement" class. Can be edited to target other classes for exclusion.

Add or change the items in the `$classes_to_skip` array to target whichever classes you need to.

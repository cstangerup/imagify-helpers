# Imagify | Do not generate WebP (since v2.2)

Skip generating WebP files in Imagify v2.2+


Use this helper plugin to prevent generating WebP files in Imagify v2.2+ when AVIF conversion option is turned off.

When AVIF conversion feature is not active, WebP will be generated by default. When AVIF conversion feature is turned ON, WebP will not be generated so this helper would not be needed in that case.

To be used with:
* Imagify v2.2+

Last tested with:
* Imagify {2.2.0.1}
* WordPress {6.3.2}
